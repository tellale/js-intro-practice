## Challenge for Intro to JavaScript

Welcome to my challenge practice part of the Intro to JavaScript class. In this file you will find a student management system displayed on console use JavaScript and node.js

The Student Management System have 18 action which can be performed by entering in the console the number of the action you want. 
The data of the students is self populated at the moment, if you want to include the data of new random students, you can run the script under the file students-data.js to generate a random array based on the available names and genres arrays on the same file. 
If you want to exit the script, you need to typo 0, any letter or fraction. 

In the folder you will find 2 different implementations of the same Student Management System, one using Switch and other one using an Object. 
My personal recommendation is to use the second one, using an Object, since it will be easier to maintain and less prone to error or typing mistakes. Although, both version performed the same functionalities.
